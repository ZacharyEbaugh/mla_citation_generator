Given a file with a list of links, this program will generate two files, one with the list of citations it successfully got mla formatted citations for and another with the list of links it failed to generate citations for.

# Requirements
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages.

# Links File
This program will read from a file called list_links.txt, this should contain all of the links you want to be generated as mla formatted citations.  Each link must be on it's own line.
